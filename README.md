# AndroidApp (Weather forecast)

 This App uses REST API to query the NOAA service APIs in order to provide weather cast information. 
 The NOAA service API offers the forecast via https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}/forecast and https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}

 This App is inspired by porject #2 of "Advanced Programing concepts" class @ Merrimack College Spring 2025
